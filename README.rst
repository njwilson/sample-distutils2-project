Sample Distutils2 Project
=========================

This repository includes a very basic sample project packaged with
`packaging`/`distutils2`. It doesn't do anything interesting (yet?).

To install it, you must be using Python 3.3 (which includes `packaging`) or an
earlier version of Python with the `distutils2`_ project installed.
